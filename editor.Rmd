## Review a Post
This section explains how to review a post.
The editor for a post is typically the Community Manager or their intern.

A post is submitted as a pull request on GitHub and we use the GitHub web interface to suggest edits, make comments, and ultimately merge the pull request to publish the post.

To ask the author to address a comment, provide a link to the appropriate section of this book to guide them.

Copy and paste this checklist into the GitHub review. Items marked '(SwPR)' apply only to posts about peer reviewed packages.

```{r checklisteditor, echo = FALSE}
library("magrittr")
readLines(file.path("checklists", "editor-checklist.csv")) %>%
  gluedown::md_task() %>%
  glue::glue_collapse("\n") -> x
glue::glue("````markdown\n{x}\n````") %>% 
  knitr::asis_output()
```



## Publish a Post
Publish a post by merging its pull request.
For a post dated e.g. 2020-02-28, you can merge it any time after ~5pm Pacific on 2020-02-27 i.e. when it's Feb 28th somewhere in the world.
When possible, it's nice to have a post published by morning in the timezone of the main post author. 

Editor adds the YAML `topicid` of a post by adding an entry - called a "topic" for the post in our [discussion forum blogs category](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/blog/).
When an entry is created, the topicid is the number at the end of the topic's URL.

## Promote a Post
Tweet from [rOpenSci](https://twitter.com/rOpenSci) with a link to the post, tagging post author(s) and package reviewers with a link to the software peer review thread where relevant.

For a tweet about a package post, make the package name a hashtag, since [rocitations twitter](https://twitter.com/rocitations) does this to announce package citations.

We tweet at ~8am Pacific, but it would be good to use a system for optimizing the time to send a tweet (e.g. using Buffer). 

Note that in Tweetdeck you can schedule an individual tweet, but you cannot schedule subsequent tweets in a thread.
Therefore, it's best to draft tweets in advance (e.g. while reviewing the post) and have a feature image(s) and alternative text for the image ready to use.

Example 2-tweet thread (emojis optional):
