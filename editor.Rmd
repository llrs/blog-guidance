## Review a Post
This section explains how to review a post. The editor for a post is typically the Community Manager or their intern.

A post is submitted as a pull request on GitHub and we use the GitHub web interface to suggest edits, make comments, and ultimately merge the pull request to publish the post.

Copy the checklist into the GitHub review

To ask the author to address a comment, provide a link to the appropriate section of this book to guide them.


## Publish a Post
Publish a post by merging its pull request. For a post dated e.g. 2020-02-28, you can merge it any time after ~5pm Pacific on 2020-02-27 i.e. when it's Feb 28th somewhere in the world. When possible, it's nice to have a post published by morning in the timezone of the main post author. 

Editor adds the YAML `topicid` of a post by adding an entry - called a "topic" for the post in our [discussion forum blogs category](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/blog/). When an entry is created, the topicid is the number at the end of the topic's URL.

## Promote a Post
Until we use a system for optimizing the time to send a tweet (e.g. using Buffer), we tweet at ~8am Pacific. 

Note that in Tweetdeck you can schedule an individual tweet, but you cannot schedule subsequent tweets in a thread. 

NOTE copy here the text from `authorpromote.Rmd` and include example tweets
