# Diving In

Now let's talk screenshots! Using the in development `webshot2` package.

For now screenshots of authenticated pages isn't supported (i.e. GitHub as one sees it when authenticated) which is fine 


```{r authorpage}
webshot2::rmdshot("https://ropensci.org/authors/kelly-obriant/",
                  selector = "section.author",
                  expand = c(50, # top
                             0, # right
                             0, # bottom
                             0 #left
                             )
                  )

```
