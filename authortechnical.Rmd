# Technical Guidelines {#technical}

This chapter explains the technical details of submitting a blog post or tech note for publication on the rOpenSci website.

1. Fork the repository (repo) of the rOpenSci website
1.  Draft your post in R Markdown or Markdown
1.  Preview and refine your post locally (optional)
1. Submit via pull request, preview, and refine your post in the rOpenSci website repo
1. Community Manager or other staff member reviews your post
1. Revise your post in response to review

## Fork the repo and choose your workflow

Fork the rOpenSci website [repository](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2) and create a new branch to work on your post. For help with this we recommend [happygitwithr](https://happygitwithr.com/fork-and-clone.html) and the [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package.

Prepare your post in whichever way is most comfortable for you. You can write your post:

- in your favorite editor in R Markdown or Markdown by starting with templates we provide

```{r posttemplatemd, results="asis"}
show_template("post-template.md", 
              lang = "yaml",
              details = TRUE
)
```
ADD.Rmd template here 

- or by using the [roblog helper package](https://docs.ropensci.org/roblog/) created for this purpose. Installing roblog allows you to use RStudio addins to get templates and to run some pre-submission checks.
    - Install roblog via `install.packages("roblog", repos = "https://dev.ropensci.org")`
    - Start a new post
      - in RStudio, using the roblog Addins
      - or at the command-line, using `roblog::ro_blog_post_rmd()` or `roblog::ro_blog_post_md()`

## Walkthrough with code snippets

### What goes in YAML

This is the YAML from our post template, with comments to explain some components:

(SUGGESTION: I think this example YAML should be the Rmd one, so the use of `output: ` can be explained. LINK "post template" phrase above to post-template.Rmd )

```{r posttemplate, results="asis"}
show_template("post-template.md", lang = "yaml",
              yaml_only = TRUE)
```

NOTE include advice on Twitter cards (in Ch3 Publication and Promotion?) and twitterImg.

### Add an image {#addimage}
If your blog post has any images that are **not** generated from R Markdown, create a folder under `themes/ropensci/static/img/blog-images/` with the pattern `<DATE-SLUG>` (e.g. 2019-06-04-post-template) and place them there. To reference them in your post, use `/img/blog-images/<DATE-SLUG>/name-of-image.png`. If the paths are correct, you should see the preview render correctly (LINK TO PREVIEW INFO). 

- Insert an image `{{< figure src = "/img/blog-images/2019-06-04-post-template/name-of-image.png" width = "200" alt = "this is the alternative text" >}}`

- Insert the same image, but centered and bigger. Notice ` width` and `class`. `{{< figure src = "/img/blog-images/2019-06-04-post-template/name-of-image.png" width = "400" alt = "this is the alternative text" class = "center" >}}`

- To insert the image aligned to the right, use `class = "pull-right"`

MAËLLE: Can you draft best way to add Rmd image instructions? We need to make instructions for md and Rmd approaches consistent e.g. always list md first then Rmd, or vice versa
https://docs.ropensci.org/roblog/articles/rmd-guidance.html 

Every image should be accompanied by alternative text (`alt="some text"`) to make it more accessible to people with disabilities and provide a better user experience for everyone. The alternative text should convey the meaning or content that is displayed in the image. Refer [to this tutorial](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/) for details on what should go in alternative text.

### Add a tweet

Use a Hugo shortcode to embed a tweet using its ID e.g. `{{< tweet 1138216112808529920 >}}`

### Add a citation

To add citations, refer to them in the body of your post:
```
Citation of the primary literature[^1].
Citation of an R package[^2].
Citation of a website[^3].
```

And list your sources at the bottom of your post:

```
[^1]: Sciaini, M., Fritsch, M., Scherer, C., & Simpkins, C. E. (2018). NLMR and landscapetools: An integrated environment for simulating and modifying neutral landscape models in R. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 9(11), 2240-2248. <https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13076>

[^3]: Hugo static site generator. https://gohugo.io/
```

#### How to find citation text for a package or article

To get the citation for an R package, run `citation("packagename")`.

To get the citation for an article, you can use the RStudio Addin for [rcrossref](https://docs.ropensci.org/rcrossref/), or get the citation from a paper's DOI by running e.g.

```
rcrossref::cr_cn("10.1111/2041-210X.13076", format="text", style="apa")

[1] "Sciaini, M., Fritsch, M., Scherer, C., & Simpkins, C. E. (2018). NLMRandlandscapetools: An integrated environment for simulating and modifying neutral landscape models inR. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 9(11), 2240–2248. doi:10.1111/2041-210x.13076"
```

To get the citation for an article in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), find the article, click the quote symbol (in search results under the article) to open the "Cite" window, and copy the APA style text.


```{r citation, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Get a citation from Google Scholar."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/citation-gscholar.png")
```

### Add tags

Add tags to the YAML of your post to make it more findable. Browse [our page that lists all tags in use](https://ropensci.org/tags/) and re-use an existing tag rather than creating a new one e.g. 'packages' exists, so use that, rather than 'package'.

For a post about your peer-reviewed package, use 'Software Peer Review', 'R', 'community', 'packages', the package name, tags that were [topic labels](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/labels) in your package review such as 'data-access', and any others you see fit.

### Examples

- A blog post about a package that has passed software peer review. Compare [raw markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/roweb2/master/content/blog/2019-10-21-rmangal.md) with [live post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/10/21/rmangal/)

- A technote. Compare [raw markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/roweb2/master/content/technotes/2018-10-06-av-release.md) with [live tech note](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2018/10/06/av-release/)

## Style guide
adapted from: https://github.com/ropenscilabs/roblog/blob/master/vignettes/styleguide.Rmd

- For formatting of package names, functions, and code, follow the [tidyverse style guidance](https://style.tidyverse.org/documentation.html#r-code).
- Use ### or #### to format headings in your post; larger sizes don't look good. Note long headings with #### don't currently wrap well.
- Use title case for the title of your post; use sentence case for headings inside the post.
- 'rOpenSci' not 'ROpenSci'
- When adding links to your post, use relative instead of absolute URLs e.g. `/blog/` instead of `https://ropensci.org/blog/`.
- Use [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes) (not html) to add images, tweets, gists etc.
- Use informative [alternative text](#addimage) for all images.
- Add new line at end of each sentence (makes diffs easier to interpret and easier for editor to suggest specific changes) MAELLE we should link to outside explanation

## Create or update your author file

### Why?
The rOpenSci website has a page listing [all authors](https://ropensci.org/authors/) who have contributed to a blog post, tech note, or presented in a Community Call. A click on your by-line in a post takes the reader to your author page that has links to your online home, possibly your Twitter or GitHub, and a list of all the content you’ve authored on our site. For staff and leadership team members, editors for software peer review, or members of our Code of Conduct Committee, their rOpenSci title is also listed on their author page.


### How?
If you don't already have an author page, create a folder called `yourfirstname-yourlastname` in your local copy of [`roweb2/content/authors/`](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/tree/master/content/authors). You can have accents, middle initials, or hyphens appear in your name if you name your folder appropriately (it can be tricky). If you're not sure how to do this, look at [other people's folder names](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/tree/master/content/authors) for examples. 

In that folder, create a file called `_index.md` with information about your online presence. You can copy this template:

```{r authorfiletemplate1, results="asis"}
show_template("author-file-template.md", 
              lang = "yaml",
              details = TRUE
)
```

At minimum, provide your name and a link or your Twitter, GitHub, or GitLab username. Add your usernames or ID's without the "@" or the "https:..."). The link field can be your personal website URL, for example.


**NOTE** Maëlle can you please adapt text to add how to use RStudio add-in or run `roblog::ro_blog_post_author()` as done in https://github.com/ropenscilabs/roblog/blob/master/vignettes/author-file-guidance.Rmd

## Pre-submission checklists
Instructions to copy the relevant checklist into a comment on your pull request

See roblog "check your post"
- `ro_lint_md()` to check and enforce use of complete alternative descriptions for image, of relative links to rOpenSci website, of Hugo shortcodes for tweets, of lower camelCase for rOpenSci name.
- `ro_check_urls()` https://docs.ropensci.org/roblog/articles/checks-guidance.html


## Submit your draft post
Once you've drafted your blog post, you can [preview locally using Hugo](#localpreview) (recommended) or skip to the next step to make a pull request and preview that.

### Local preview with Hugo {#localpreview}

If you wish to preview your post locally, as it will appear in our site, you must install Hugo. To install, refer to [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) or run `blogdown::install_hugo()`.

Then run `hugo serve` in the repo directory to start a local server on http://localhost:1313. 

The version of Hugo used by the rOpenSci web server is defined in [netlify.toml](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/netlify.toml).

When this preview looks good to you, you should submit your post as a pull request.

### Make a pull request

Knitting the Rmd of your post will generate both .html and .md files. Please do not include the .html in your pull request.

Send a pull request from your fork at least one week prior to the planned publication date to allow time for review. Netlify will start building the new version of the site within seconds and you can preview your changes to make sure everything looks as intended. Otherwise push additional fixes till things look right.

```{r hugochecks, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Some checks haven't completed yet."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hugochecks.png")
```

```{r hugocheckspassed, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "All checks have passed."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hugocheckspassed.png")
```

Tag rOpenSci's Community Manager ([`@stefaniebutland`](https://github.com/stefaniebutland)) to review your pull request.
