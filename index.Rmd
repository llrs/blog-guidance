# Preface {-}

The purpose of this documentation is to provide [content](#content) and [technical](#technical) guidelines for authors and editors of blog posts and tech notes for the rOpenSci website.
We created it after reviewing and publishing over 100 posts by community members, in hopes of addressing many frequently asked questions, and frequently given suggestions. 

The volume of information may be overwhelming at first. Some of the guidance indicates things we require that you do (such as creating an author file with your metadata), while most of the guidance is information to help you (such as how to add an image to your post).

If you find any errors or things that need clarification, we would be grateful if you opened an issue or pull request in the [repository for this book](https://github.com/ropensci-org/blog-guidance).

_We are thankful for the feedback and contributions by [Steffi LaZerte](https://github.com/steffilazerte)._
